### Notes about Data 
Since the data is big (20 gig) it is not included in this repo. To get the data run 
```bash
utils/data_download/download_all_data.sh
```

## MSD-LIVE customization via plugin:
Instead of copying /notebooks to /home/jovyan dir we need the files to be directly under the user's home dir
